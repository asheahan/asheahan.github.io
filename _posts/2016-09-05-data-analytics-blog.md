Well, this is hopefully the start to an almost weekly posting about random open source data and any insights I can glean from them. I'll be trying to showcase and improve my analytical abilities using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/). Hoping to learn predictive and text analytics techniques with machine learning and natural language processing so stay tuned.
