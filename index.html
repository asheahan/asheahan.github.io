  	<p>Hey there, I'm Andrew and welcome to the site. This is my space where I can console.log(myProgress) as I attempt to satisfy my technological curiosities with various experiments.</p>
    <p>I consider myself a novice web developer, specializing in Express with Node.js and AngularJS. I've also dabbled in developing sites in PHP, Rails, and Java Spring, but I love the versatility and functionality that comes with using the same language on the front and back end.</p>
    <p>I've become very enthusiastic about data analytics, as many others, in this age of massive amounts of data. In addition to using SQL and relational databases, I've been using R to perform more statistical analyses. As an extension to that, R has been my avenue to explore machine learning and predictive modeling.</p>
  	<p>Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions! I'm eager to learn new things so would appreciate any help!</p>
